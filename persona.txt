Results(Where most of the app has data)
1. Ferritin : [a]
* Ferritin levels indirectly measures the total amount of iron stored in your body. It acts as a buffer against iron deficiency and iron overload.
* PT: 132 ng/mL
  

* Normal value shows that you have a sufficient amount of iron in your blood to assist in carrying oxygen throughout your body.
* Low value shows a risk for lack of iron, which could lead to anemia, a decrease in the amount of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, reducing the ability of blood to carry oxygen. It can lead to shortness of breath, tired feeling, and weakness. 
* High value shows excess iron levels, or is a sign of infection. High ferritin levels can signal iron overload disorders, such as hemochromatosis which is an inherited disease.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin#Deficiency
1. Iron
* Iron is a mineral that your body needs for many functions. It helps your muscle store and use oxygen and it is also a component of hemoglobin, a protein that distributes oxygen from your lungs throughout your body.
* PT: See #1 Ferritin and #4 CBC for results
   1. Hematocrit: Men, 38.8-50%, Women, 34.9-44.5% 
   2. Hemoglobin: Men, 13.5-17.5 g/dL, Women, 12-15.5 g/dL
   3. Ferritin: low levels for iron deficiency
   4. From Mayo Clinic
* Normal value shows that you have a sufficient amount of iron in your blood to assist in carrying oxygen throughout your body.
* Low value shows low iron levels, and could lead to iron deficiency, also known as anemia. Low levels could be due to blood loss or a lack of ability to absorb iron from your diet. 
* High value shows an overload of iron in your body. This could be due to taking too many iron supplements which could lead to iron poisoning, or hemochromatosis which is an inherited disease.

1. Glucose
* Glucose is a type of sugar that your body uses for energy, and is the main source of fuel for your brain. 
* PT: Random Test 120mg/dL
   1. For a fasting blood glucose test, a level between 70 and 100 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.6 mmol/L) is considered normal.  100-125 mg/dL is prediabetic. 126+ mg/dL is diabetic.
   2. For a random test, Most of the time, the blood glucose level will be below 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L). Above 200mg/dL usually means you have diabetes        
   3. From MedlinePlus
* Normal value shows that the level of glucose in your blood is constant. Your pancreas is working normally to make insulin, which brings the glucose in your blood steam into your cells.
* Low value : without enough glucose, your body cannot perform its normal functions. Low blood glucose is also known as hypoglycemia. This could be a side effect of diabetes treatment and could lead to pale skin, blurry vision, and dizziness, to name a few.
* High value: This is also known as hyperglycemia. High blood glucose could damage the vessels that carry blood into your organs. It can also increase your risk for heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage.
* https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/glucose-diabetes#1
1. CBC (complete blood count)
* PT: listed below
        RBC: 5 trillion/L, 
   * Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which is in charge of carrying oxygen to your body’s tissues. The number of red blood cells you have affect how much oxygen your tissues receive, and your tissues need oxygen to function
   * Normal value  shows that you have a normal amount of red blood cells and that your tissues are receiving an adequate amount of oxygen they need to function.
   * Low value (4.32 mcL) can be due to anemia or certain drugs. Any recent dietary changes could also change your red blood cell count. A low red blood cell count could indicate that your tissues are not receiving enough oxygen.
   * High value (5.72 mcL) indicates you have erythrocytosis and may be due to a decrease in oxygen supply. This condition can make your blood thicker and lead to blood clots or other complications.
Hemoglobin: 15.2 g/dL, 
-Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries and facilities the process of moving oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. It also aids the process of metabolism throughout the body. Hemoglobin helps maintain the shape of red blood cells as well. 
-Normal value shows that you have a normal amount hemoblogin. The amount of hemoglobin in the blood affects the movement of oxygen throughout the body and maintains healthy red blood cells. 
-Low value: (Below 13.5 g/dL) indicates that you have anemia. There are many forms of anemia and each have different causes and symptoms. 
-High value (Above 17.5 g/dL) idnicates that you have an above-normal level of hemoglobin in your blood. High levels of hemoglobin are associated with smoking and living in high altitudes. 
Hematocrit: 42%,
-  Hematocrit is the ratio of red blood cells to total volume of blood in a person. Red blood cells are used to carry oxygen throughout the body. 
- Low Value: Less than 42%. Low levels of hematocrit are often referred to anemia. This is associated with hemophilia, ulcers, sickle cell disease, and internal bleeding. 
-Normal Value: Normal levels of hematocrit is between 42% and 54%. These levels of hematocrit are associated with proper respiration, good heart function, and balanced energy levels.
-High Value: High levels of hematocrit are above 54%. Such high levels are associated with dehydration, kidney disease, and heart disease.    
WBC: 7 billion/L, 
Platelet:  322 billion/L
  
 
   1. From Mayo Clinic
   1. WBC        
   1. Description: White blood cells are infection-fighting cells in the blood.
   2. High: More than 11,000 cells per cubic millimeter of blood is a high concentration level of white blood cells in your body. This condition is called Leukocytosis and their is an inflammatory response (reddened, swollen, hot, and painful reaction) in your body.
   3. Normal: 4,300-10,800 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. Your body has a good amount of white blood cells to fight off foreign agents in your body.
   4. Low: A low concentration of white blood cells in your body is less than 1,500 microliter. This condition is called Neutropenia and your body’s natural ability to fight off infection is decreased. 
   5. https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9983 
   1. Platelet
   1. Description: Platelets are blood cells that help clot blood to stop bleeding.
   2. High: More than 450,000 per microliter of blood. With a high concentration of platelets this can lead a person to have reactions to medicine and it can cause inflammation within the body.
   3. Normal: 150,000-450,000 per microliter of blood. With this level of platelets in your system, your body can clot blood regularly.
   4. Low: Less than 150,000 per microliter of blood. With a low amount of platelets in your system, getting a cut is dangerous as your blood will not clot very fast. Bleeding from small wounds can be serious.

   3. Diagnosis of diabetes: 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or above 
   4. High Value of fasting glucose can mean you either have impaired fasting glucose, or you have diabetes. Other causes could include hyperactive thyroid, pancreatic problems (cancer, inflammation, etc), or stress from cardiovascular problems. 
   5. Low Value of fasting glucose is called hypoglycemia. It is common in people with Type 1 diabetes and symptoms may show as shaking, sweating, dizzy, disoriented, feeling week, trouble concentrating, and in extreme cases, unconsciousness and seizures. Eating or drinking carbohydrates, or taking glucose pills can bring this value up to the normal range. Causes of low fasting glucose could be hypopituitarism, underactive thyroid, tumor in the pancreas, liver disease, or kidney disease.
   6. Normal Value shows you are taking eating well in providing glucose for your cells to use as energy. Fasting glucose is also used to screen for diabetes, and a normal range is a good indicator that you do not have diabetes.
